       Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December
indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has
been rising at a solid rate. Job gains have been strong, on average, in recent months, and
the unemployment rate has remained low. Household spending has continued to grow
strongly, while growth of business fixed investment has moderated from its rapid pace
earlier last year. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other
than food and energy remain near 2 percent. Although market-based measures of
inflation compensation have moved lower in recent months, survey-based measures of
longer-term inflation expectations are little changed.
       Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum
employment and price stability. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to
maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent. The
Committee continues to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor
market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective as
the most likely outcomes. In light of global economic and financial developments and
muted inflation pressures, the Committee will be patient as it determines what future
adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate to support
these outcomes.
       In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the
federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions
relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation
objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including
measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation

               Decisions Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation

The Federal Reserve has made the following decisions to implement the monetary policy
stance announced by the Federal Open Market Committee in its statement on January 30,
2019:

   •   The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to
       maintain the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances at 2.40
       percent, effective January 31, 2019.

   •   As part of its policy decision, the Federal Open Market Committee voted to
       authorize and direct the Open Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New
       York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Open
       Market Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:

              “Effective January 31, 2019, the Federal Open Market Committee directs
              the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the
              federal funds rate in a target range of 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent, including
              overnight reverse repurchase operations (and reverse repurchase
              operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to
              accommodate weekend, holiday, or similar trading conventions) at an
              offering rate of 2.25 percent, in amounts limited only by the value of
              Treasury securities held outright in the System Open Market Account that
              are available for such operations and by a per counterparty limit of $30
              billion per day.

              The Committee directs the Desk to continue rolling over at auction the
              amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of
              Treasury securities maturing during each calendar month that exceeds $30
              billion, and to continue reinvesting in agency mortgage-backed securities
              the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of
              agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities received during each
              calendar month that exceeds $20 billion. Small deviations from these
              amounts for operational reasons are acceptable.

              The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon
              swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal
              Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed securities transactions.”

   •   In a related action, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted
       unanimously to approve the establishment of the primary credit rate at the existing
       level of 3.00 percent.
