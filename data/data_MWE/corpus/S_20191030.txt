For release at 2 p.m. EDT                                                         October 30, 2019


       Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September
indicates that the labor market remains strong and that economic activity has been rising at a
moderate rate. Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment
rate has remained low. Although household spending has been rising at a strong pace, business
fixed investment and exports remain weak. On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation
for items other than food and energy are running below 2 percent. Market-based measures of
inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations
are little changed.
       Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum
employment and price stability. In light of the implications of global developments for the
economic outlook as well as muted inflation pressures, the Committee decided to lower the
target range for the federal funds rate to 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent. This action supports the
Committee’s view that sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions,
and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective are the most likely outcomes,
but uncertainties about this outlook remain. The Committee will continue to monitor the
implications of incoming information for the economic outlook as it assesses the appropriate
path of the target range for the federal funds rate.
       In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal
funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its
maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This
assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor
market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on
financial and international developments.

                   Decisions Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation
The Federal Reserve has made the following decisions to implement the monetary policy stance
announced by the Federal Open Market Committee in its statement on October 30, 2019:
       •   The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to lower
           the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances to 1.55 percent,
           effective October 31, 2019.
       •   As part of its policy decision, the Federal Open Market Committee voted to authorize
           and direct the Open Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until
           instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in
           accordance with the following domestic policy directive:
              “Effective October 31, 2019, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the
              Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal
              funds rate in a target range of 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent. In light of recent and
              expected increases in the Federal Reserve’s non-reserve liabilities, the Committee
              directs the Desk to purchase Treasury bills at least into the second quarter of next
              year to maintain over time ample reserve balances at or above the level that
              prevailed in early September 2019. The Committee also directs the Desk to
              conduct term and overnight repurchase agreement operations at least through
              January of next year to ensure that the supply of reserves remains ample even
              during periods of sharp increases in non-reserve liabilities, and to mitigate the risk
              of money market pressures that could adversely affect policy implementation. In
              addition, the Committee directs the Desk to conduct overnight reverse repurchase
              operations (and reverse repurchase operations with maturities of more than one
              day when necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday, or similar trading
              conventions) at an offering rate of 1.45 percent, in amounts limited only by the
              value of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open Market Account
              that are available for such operations and by a per-counterparty limit of
              $30 billion per day.

              The Committee directs the Desk to continue rolling over at auction all principal
              payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and to
              continue reinvesting all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings
              of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities received during each
              calendar month. Principal payments from agency debt and agency mortgage-
              backed securities up to $20 billion per month will continue to be reinvested in
              Treasury securities to roughly match the maturity composition of Treasury
              securities outstanding; principal payments in excess of $20 billion per month will
              continue to be reinvested in agency mortgage-backed securities. Small deviations
              from these amounts for operational reasons are acceptable.

              The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap
              transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency
              mortgage-backed securities transactions.”

       •   In a related action, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted
           unanimously to approve a 1/4 percentage point decrease in the primary credit rate to
           2.25 percent, effective October 31, 2019. In taking this action, the Board approved
           requests to establish that rate submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal
           Reserve Banks of Minneapolis and San Francisco.
This information will be updated as appropriate to reflect decisions of the Federal Open Market
Committee or the Board of Governors regarding details of the Federal Reserve's operational tools
and approach used to implement monetary policy.

Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s website.
