For release at 2 p.m. EST                                                December 11, 2019


       Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in October
indicates that the labor market remains strong and that economic activity has been rising
at a moderate rate. Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the
unemployment rate has remained low. Although household spending has been rising at a
strong pace, business fixed investment and exports remain weak. On a 12-month basis,
overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy are running below 2
percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based
measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed.
       Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum
employment and price stability. The Committee decided to maintain the target range for
the federal funds rate at 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent. The Committee judges that the current
stance of monetary policy is appropriate to support sustained expansion of economic
activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric
2 percent objective. The Committee will continue to monitor the implications of
incoming information for the economic outlook, including global developments and
muted inflation pressures, as it assesses the appropriate path of the target range for the
federal funds rate.
       In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the
federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions
relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation
objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including
measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation
expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.

                Decisions Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation
The Federal Reserve has made the following decisions to implement the monetary policy
stance announced by the Federal Open Market Committee in its statement on December
11, 2019:
 •   The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to
     maintain the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances at 1.55
     percent, effective December 12, 2019.
 •   As part of its policy decision, the Federal Open Market Committee voted to
     authorize and direct the Open Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New
     York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Open Market
     Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:
       “Effective December 12, 2019, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the
       Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal
       funds rate in a target range of 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent. In light of recent and
       expected increases in the Federal Reserve’s non-reserve liabilities, the Committee
       directs the Desk to continue purchasing Treasury bills at least into the second
       quarter of 2020 to maintain over time ample reserve balances at or above the level
       that prevailed in early September 2019. The Committee also directs the Desk to
       continue conducting term and overnight repurchase agreement operations at least
       through January 2020 to ensure that the supply of reserves remains ample even
       during periods of sharp increases in non-reserve liabilities, and to mitigate the risk
       of money market pressures that could adversely affect policy implementation. In
       addition, the Committee directs the Desk to conduct overnight reverse repurchase
       operations (and reverse repurchase operations with maturities of more than one
       day when necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday, or similar trading
       conventions) at an offering rate of 1.45 percent, in amounts limited only by the
       value of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open Market Account
       that are available for such operations and by a per-counterparty limit of $30
       billion per day.

       The Committee directs the Desk to continue rolling over at auction all principal
       payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and to
       continue reinvesting all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings
       of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities received during each
       calendar month. Principal payments from agency debt and agency mortgage-
       backed securities up to $20 billion per month will continue to be reinvested in
       Treasury securities to roughly match the maturity composition of Treasury
       securities outstanding; principal payments in excess of $20 billion per month will
       continue to be reinvested in agency mortgage-backed securities. Small deviations
       from these amounts for operational reasons are acceptable.

       The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap
       transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency
       mortgage-backed securities transactions.”

 •   In a related action, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted
     unanimously to approve the establishment of the primary credit rate at the existing
     level of 2.25 percent.
This information will be updated as appropriate to reflect decisions of the Federal Open
Market Committee or the Board of Governors regarding details of the Federal Reserve’s
operational tools and approach used to implement monetary policy.

the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s website.
