For release at 2 p.m. EDT                                                            July 31, 2019


       Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June indicates
that the labor market remains strong and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate
rate. Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has
remained low. Although growth of household spending has picked up from earlier in the year,
growth of business fixed investment has been soft. On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and
inflation for items other than food and energy are running below 2 percent. Market-based
measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation
expectations are little changed.
       Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum
employment and price stability. In light of the implications of global developments for the
economic outlook as well as muted inflation pressures, the Committee decided to lower the
target range for the federal funds rate to 2 to 2-1/4 percent. This action supports the Committee’s
view that sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation
near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective are the most likely outcomes, but
uncertainties about this outlook remain. As the Committee contemplates the future path of the
target range for the federal funds rate, it will continue to monitor the implications of incoming
information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a
strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 2 percent objective.
       In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal
funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its
maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This
assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor
market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on
financial and international developments.

       The Committee will conclude the reduction of its aggregate securities holdings in the
System Open Market Account in August, two months earlier than previously indicated.
       Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell, Chair; John C. Williams,
Vice Chair; Michelle W. Bowman; Lael Brainard; James Bullard; Richard H. Clarida; Charles L.
Evans; and Randal K. Quarles. Voting against the action were Esther L. George and Eric S.
Rosengren, who preferred at this meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at
2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent.

                   Decisions Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation

The Federal Reserve has made the following decisions to implement the monetary policy stance
announced by the Federal Open Market Committee in its statement on July 31, 2019:

       •   The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to lower
           the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances to 2.10 percent,
           effective August 1, 2019.
       •   As part of its policy decision, the Federal Open Market Committee voted to authorize
           and direct the Open Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until
           instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in
           accordance with the following domestic policy directive:

              “Effective August 1, 2019, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk
              to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds
              rate in a target range of 2 to 2-1/4 percent, including overnight reverse repurchase
              operations (and reverse repurchase operations with maturities of more than one
              day when necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday, or similar trading
              conventions) at an offering rate of 2.00 percent, in amounts limited only by the
              value of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open Market Account
              that are available for such operations and by a per-counterparty limit of
              $30 billion per day.

              Effective August 1, 2019, the Committee directs the Desk to roll over at auction
              all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities
              and to reinvest all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of
              agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities received during each
              calendar month. Principal payments from agency debt and agency mortgage-
              backed securities up to $20 billion per month will be reinvested in Treasury
              securities to roughly match the maturity composition of Treasury securities
              outstanding; principal payments in excess of $20 billion per month will continue
              to be reinvested in agency mortgage-backed securities. Small deviations from
              these amounts for operational reasons are acceptable.

              The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap
              transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency
              mortgage-backed securities transactions.”

                                              -2-
       •   In a related action, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted
           unanimously to approve a 1/4 percentage point decrease in the primary credit rate to
           2.75 percent, effective August 1, 2019. In taking this action, the Board approved
           requests to establish that rate submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal
           Reserve Banks of Philadelphia, Chicago, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco.

This information will be updated as appropriate to reflect decisions of the Federal Open Market
Committee or the Board of Governors regarding details of the Federal Reserve’s operational
tools and approach used to implement monetary policy.

Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s website.
